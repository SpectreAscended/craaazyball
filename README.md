# Craaazyball

Prototype for Craaazyball. Version 1


Follow the target ball as it moves and changes color.  After 10 movements, click whichever ball you think is the target ball.
In future builds, each level will increase the number of balls and slightly speed up their motion.  In final build level 1 will start with 4 balls and be considerably slower than the current build.
